## Verification Results
- ✅ **Static analysis**: No imports reference deleted files (grep search confirmed)
- ✅ **TypeScript check**: No "cannot find module" errors for deleted files
- ⚠️ **Build status**: Pre-existing build errors unrelated to deletions
  - Errors in `src/styles/halloween/borders.test.ts` (TypeScript type mismatches)
  - Errors in `/_global-error` page prerendering (React context issues)
- ✅ **Files truly unused**: Confirmed via grep for import statements

## Verification Details

### Static Analysis Checks Performed
1. ✅ Searched for dynamic imports - none found
2. ✅ Searched for string-based references - none found
3. ✅ Checked barrel file exports - none of deleted files were re-exported
4. ✅ Verified no test files depend on these components
5. ✅ Checked configuration files - no references found

### Framework-Specific Checks (Next.js)
1. ✅ Not used by Next.js router (no app directory convention usage)
2. ✅ No Server Actions or API route handlers reference these files
3. ✅ No middleware or layout dependencies
4. ✅ Not referenced in any config files

## Recovery Instructions

To recover any deleted file:
```bash
# View file content from last commit
git show HEAD:<filepath>

# Restore a specific file
git checkout HEAD -- <filepath>
```

Example:
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- src/app/features/editor/nodes/CustomNode.tsx
```

## Next Steps
- None required. Files were already deleted in working tree before this analysis.
- Consider reviewing the pre-existing build errors if build needs to pass.
