# HyperCard Renaissance

> **Monthly Hackathon Project** — Reviving Apple's HyperCard (1987) as a modern AI-powered interactive story platform.

## What Is This?

HyperCard Renaissance transforms the groundbreaking concept of Apple's HyperCard — the original "software construction kit" that let anyone create interactive applications — into a modern web-based storytelling platform enhanced with artificial intelligence.

**The Vision:** Enable anyone to create professional-quality interactive stories, branching narratives, and visual novels without coding — just like HyperCard democratized software creation in the late 1980s.

## Key Features

### 📖 Interactive Story Creation
- **Visual Story Graph** — Design branching narratives with an intuitive node-based editor
- **Card-Based Structure** — Each scene is a "card" with narrative text, images, and choices
- **Choice Navigation** — Create meaningful decisions that lead readers through different story paths
- **One-Click Publishing** — Share stories instantly with a unique URL

### 🎨 Character System
- **Reusable Characters** — Define characters once, use them across your entire story
- **Character Cards** — Multiple visual representations for different poses and expressions
- **AI-Generated Portraits** — Create character visuals with AI image generation

### 🌙 Theming & Accessibility
- **Multiple Themes** — Light, Halloween, and more visual styles
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant** — Accessible to all users
- **Responsive Design** — Works on desktop and mobile

## AI Integration

HyperCard Renaissance leverages cutting-edge AI to supercharge storytelling:

### Anthropic Claude (Story Writing Assistant)
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4
- **Purpose:** AI-powered script and narrative generation
- **How it works:** Authors can use AI to generate story content, dialogue, and scene descriptions — then refine the output to match their creative vision

### OpenAI DALL-E (Scene Imagery)
- **Model:** DALL-E 3
- **Purpose:** Generate unique artwork for story cards
- **How it works:** Describe the scene you envision, and AI creates a matching illustration

### Bria AI (Character Integration)
- **Purpose:** Advanced character model training and scene insertion
- **How it works:** Train custom character models and seamlessly insert characters into generated scenes for consistent visual storytelling
- **Key capability:** Maintains character consistency across multiple images — a critical feature for visual narratives

## Why HyperCard?

HyperCard (1987-2004) was revolutionary — it let non-programmers create interactive applications years before the web existed. Many credit it as an inspiration for the World Wide Web itself.

**What made HyperCard special:**
- Stack-and-card metaphor (like a deck of index cards)
- Anyone could create, not just programmers
- Hyperlinking before the web
- Multimedia before multimedia was common

**What HyperCard Renaissance adds:**
- Cloud-based (access anywhere)
- AI-assisted content creation
- Modern responsive design
- Instant publishing and sharing
- Character consistency with Bria AI
