### Example output
An antique, sepia-toned ink illustration rendered on heavily textured, stained, and creased parchment paper, resembling a page from an ancient grimoire. The artistic style uses scratchy pen work, dense cross-hatching for shading, and rich brown and black inks to define forms against the cream-colored paper. On the far left, a dynamic vortex of detailed, decaying autumn leaves (oak, maple) intermingled with glowing arcane symbols, geometric runic circles, and alchemical glyphs swirls upwards in a large C-shape arc. Below this magical swirl, a woman with loosely tied-back hair, wearing a laced medieval gown and a hooded cloak, rides a dark, shaggy-maned horse. Her head is tilted back, looking up towards the swirling leaves with a gentle, expectant expression. To her right, riding parallel, a man with short hair and a beard, dressed in detailed segmented leather armor, gauntlets, and heavy boots, rides a sturdy, muscular dark horse equipped with a period saddle and bridle. He looks straight ahead with a stoic, serious face. Both horses are captured mid-stride, walking across ground marked only by sparse, ink-drawn grass tussocks in the immediate foreground. The background is entirely composed of the aged paper texture, foxing marks, and water stains, without landscape features.
