### Example breakdown
**Style:** A sepia-toned, aged ink drawing on textured parchment. It has the look of a historical illustration or a page from an old book.

**Characters:** Two figures on horseback.

- Left: A woman in a dark, medieval gown and hooded cloak, looking upwards and to the left with a gentle expression. Her horse is dark and textured.

- Right: A man in armored leather gear with a serious expression, looking forward. His horse is also dark and detailed.

**Action/Composition:** A dynamic swirl of dark, autumnal leaves and arcane symbols (runes, geometric shapes) erupts from the left side of the frame, curving towards the center above the woman.

**Environment:** The ground is sparse grass. The background is a textured, empty parchment with creases, stains, and subtle sepia variations, creating a sense of depth through negative space.

**Color Palette:** Monochromatic sepia, ranging from light cream/tan paper to dark brown and black ink lines.

**Lighting:** Soft, diffused, and warm, typical of aged paper.
